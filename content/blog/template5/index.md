##**COVID-19 Insights from [Dr. Dan Parry](https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/providers/danielparry)(my fantastic colleague and office neighbor!)**

I'll just speak from my experience here seeing patients and reading quite extensively over the past two weeks.

1) The onset of COVID-19 (especially in kids) can be quite subtle with many of them starting with subtle sore throat (maybe a 5/10), mild headache, low grade fever (higher fever certainly possible), cough starting a little later in the illness (day 2 or 3) and also being subtle in nature. It doesn't hit you like a ton of bricks necessarily like the flu. Usually not a lot of mucous/runny nose or nasal congestion (so if you're having that it is more likely a different virus or allergies). The cough is usually dry and in the chest. Sometimes (< 10%) there are only GI symptoms (this can be confusing) and really gets at the fact that COVID-19 is diverse in it's presentation.

2) Please protect your elders. Urge then to stay at home, wash their hands frequently when out. Over 70 years old especially at risk. Over 60 years old, less so but still a very palpable risk. The experience of the ICU docs in China, Italy, Seattle and NYC tells the story that this is REAL and difficult to treat. The best treatment is prevention.

3) If a family member does get sick with COVID-19 average time to bad symptoms (shortness of breath) is about 7 days, average time to intubation for those who need it is 10 days. Someone asked me this week, how do I know if I have shortness of breath? You will know, it isn't subtle. Incubation period average is 5 days (time from exposure to symptoms starting). So if our ICUs can hold the water for the next week or two, we'll be in an ok place. Then we will need to have great testing protocols in place over the next 12-18 months to make sure we can put out subsequent fires.

4) Here in SF/Daly City we are seeing cases, some patients are admitted to the hospital (not children, all adults) but we are not overrun. That may come in a few days but hopefully not. The San Jose/Santa Clara area is a larger cluster than SF. We have greater ability to test than a few days ago and much greater than a week ago and are doing tests in house now. We are not testing children unless they are admitted to the hospital so we can save the kits for adults/elderly.

5) This will be a tough time but look for the silver lining. Call your parents or grandparents to tell them you love them. I spoke with a woman today who watched her elderly mother get admitted to the hospital and had to say bye to her as she was rolled away in the wheelchair outside the hospital. I was struck that she might not see her mother again given COVID-19 infection control concerns and limits on hospital visitors

6) There are articles and stories about young people getting admitted to the hospital and the ICU. Please everyone be aware that this CAN happen but is unlikely if you are young and healthy. The lesson is don't think you're not at risk, but please don't panic. There are a few cases of children needing hospitalization but it is exceedingly rare and usually those children had other complex conditions (not just asthma, like truly complex). We need you all to stay in your lane, take care of your families and yourselves. Every moment this week where I tried to pretend like I was an epidemiologist or a public health expert or an infectious disease modeling expert caused me increased anxiety and truly didn't help me, my family or my patients. Stay in your lane. Don't try to research the numbers or research the mortality rates or read too many articles on COVID-19. Take care of yourself and your family.
