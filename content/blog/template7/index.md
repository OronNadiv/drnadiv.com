Plant-based diets prevent and reverse high cholesterol, heart disease and diabetes. In children, they decrease the risk for the common cold, ear infections and intestinal problems.  They decrease the risk for eczema, allergies and asthma. They decrease the risk for many types of cancer. They can improve mood and decrease the risk for Alzheimer's, depression and anxiety. They can prevent and treat acne. More people are learning about plant-based diets thanks to documentaries such as ["Forks Over Knives"](https://www.forksoverknives.com/) and books like ["How Not to Die"](https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-die/). Please take a few minutes to watch the trailer for Forks Over Knives.

I recently completed a course on plant-based nutrition and would like to share some of what I learned with you.
