## Living With Asthma

Asthma is very common and is often underrecognized. To make life more complicated, not all children who wheeze have asthma, and children can have asthma without wheezing (cough-variant asthma). Kids often grow out of their asthma. And most of the children I treat have *intermittent asthma symptoms* that are triggered by viral infections, allergies, or exercise. I spend A LOT of time discussing asthma and inhaler use.
