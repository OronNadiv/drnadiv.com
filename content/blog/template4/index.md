The ubiquity of refined processed foods, "kid's meals," and "picky eaters" naturally leads to constipation. **Many children have hard or painful poops and/or strain to have a bowel movement. Over time, this can cause a variety of medical issues including abdominal pain, stool leakage (encopresis), bladder infections, bed wetting, and anal fissues/hemorrhoids.**

When this is a concern, I always counsel parents to keep a "poop diary"---gross, I know, but it really helps! Knowing how often your child is pooping and what it looks/feels like can help stay on top of any constipation issues.

**How to prevent constipation**
* Minimize constipating foods: 
-Give no more than 16 ounces of milk per day.
-Bananas, white rice, white bread, bagels, pizza, cheese, ice cream can also be constipating

* Drink plenty of water and eat plenty (9 servings!) of fruits and vegetables every day.  Prunes and pears often work great:  Try 2-3 prunes daily to start (dried or pureed).

* Fiber:  Ground flax seed or benefiber:  1/2-1 tablespoon twice daily, mixed with food or drink. Increase or decrease the dose as needed to achieve about 1 soft stool daily.  Ground flax seed can be purchased at most supermarkets, and benefiber at most pharmacies. 

* Can try Smooth Move Peppermint Tea with Senna

* If this does not work, try Miralax:  1/2 to 1 capful daily mixed with 8 oz of water.   Increase or decrease the dose as needed to achieve about 1 soft stool daily.

For children with longstanding constipation, I sometimes recommend a **bowel cleanout with Magnesium Citrate**. 
Here is how to do it:

Your child should remain close to a restroom for 8-12 hours during the bowel clean-out. 
The bowel clean-out is more effective if your child limits his/her food intake the day of the clean-out. This would include water, vegetable broth, chicken broth, bouillon, consomme, juices, Gatorade, and other similar clear foods.
Your child's bowel clean-out, MAGNESIUM CITRATE, is over the counter and found at any drug store. There are a number of flavors from which to choose. Refrigerating or serving the prep on ice will make it more palatable. The clean out should be done as follows: 

Give 1 ounce/yr of age to a maximum of 10 oz of Magnesium Citrate every hour for THREE DOSES. (For example, a 5 year old child would take 5 ounces every hour for three doses for a total of 15 ounces). Your goal at the end of the clean out is to have brown watery stools.  Repeat the procedure in 24 hours if there is still solid stools the following day. 

MAINTENANCE: 
Miralax (Polyethylene glycol 3350): to be used for constipation.  

(1 capful = 17 grams)

Directions: to be added to 4-8 ounces of beverage (cold, hot, or room temperature).

Dosing by weight as an estimate, adjusting dose by one tsp every three days to a goal of 1-2 soft stools a day. 

10 lbs to 20 lbs      1/4 capful / day
20 lbs to 30 lbs      1/2 capful / day
30 lbs to 40 lbs      3/4 capful / day
> 40 lbs                  1 capful / day

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Benefiber or Metamucil Clear & Natural - dosing (to take 1-3 times daily).  Ok to take everyday if needed.  @FNAME@ should still eat a healthy diet rich in fiber.  

12 years and over:  1 to 2 tablespoons
7 to 11 years:          1/2 to 1 tablespoon 
Under age 7:           1/4 to 1/2 tablespoon 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Behavior Training: 
Sit on the toilet three times a day best 10-20 minutes after meals to take advantage of the gastro-colic reflex
