The ubiquity of refined processed foods, "kid's meals," and "picky eaters" naturally leads to constipation. Many children have hard or painful poops and/or strain to have a bowel movement. Over time, this can cause a variety of medical issues including abdominal pain, stool leakage (encopresis), bladder infections, bed wetting, and anal fissues/hemorrhoids.

I always counsel parents to keep a "poop diary"---gross, I know, but it really helps! Knowing how often your child is pooping and what it looks/feels like can help stay on top of any constipation issues.

Minimize constipating foods: 
-Give no more than 16 ounces of milk per day.
-Bananas, white rice, white bread, bagels, pizza, cheese, ice cream can also be constipating

Drink plenty of water and eat plenty (9 servings!) of fruits and vegetables every day.  Prunes and pears often work great:  Try 2-3 prunes daily to start (dried or pureed).

Fiber:  Ground flax seed or benefiber:  1/2-1 tablespoon twice daily, mixed with food or drink. Increase or decrease the dose as needed to achieve about 1 soft stool daily.  Ground flax seed can be purchased at most supermarkets, and benefiber at most pharmacies. 

Can try Smooth Move Peppermint Tea with Senna

If this does not work, try Miralax:  1/2 to 1 capful daily mixed with 8 oz of water.   Increase or decrease the dose as needed to achieve about 1 soft stool daily. 
Please let me know if these treatments do not work.
