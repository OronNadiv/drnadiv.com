I have laid out the environmental and health benefits of eating mostly plant-based foods, but how can we get our kids on board?

* Get kids involved: farmer's market outings, cooking as a family, [help kids learn to enjoy new foods](https://www.drnadiv.com/veggies/)
* Talk to kids about the reasons behind a plant based diet (take care of the earth, keep our bodies healthy)
* Look at recipes with kids and involve them in deciding which foods to make
* Start where they are by giving more of the healthy foods your children already like
* Role model healthy eating and trying new foods

### How will I ensure that my kids are getting enough calcium, protein, and all other necessary vitamins and minerals?

* Eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables every day
* **Eat protein and iron rich foods with every meal**
* Eat whole grains (whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole grain or legume-based pasta)
* Limit refined grains such as white bread, pasta, rice, sugary foods, and highly processed foods
* If you are feeding your children exclusively plant-based foods, **give a supplement of Vitamin B12 and iodine** (unless you use iodized salt)
* Take a **Vitamin D supplement and enjoy the SUNSHINE**
  
  
## HELPFUL RESOURCES
  
* [_Nourish_](https://nourishthebook.com/) is a recently published book (November 2020) written by a pediatrician and a dietician that very thoroughly describes the myriad benefits of eating more plant-based foods, explains the evidence behind their recommendations, provides clear dietary guidelines and includes a section with recipes.
