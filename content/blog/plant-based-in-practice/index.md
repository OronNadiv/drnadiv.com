Feeling inspired to try more plant-based foods in your family's diet? I'd like you to keep a few key points in mind. 

### Get Kids on Board and Excited

* Actively involve your children: farmers' market outings, cooking as a family, becoming acquainted with vegetables in a playful setting (see [Adventures in Veggieland](https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Veggieland-Vegetables_with-Activities-Recipes/dp/1615194061) for details and fun activities to try with your kids!
* Talk to kids about the reasons behind a plant based diet (take care of the earth, keep our bodies healthy). There are several wonderful children's books that can facilitate this discussion with your children
* Look at recipes with your kids and involve them in deciding which foods to make
* Start where they are by giving more of the healthy foods they already like
* Role model healthy eating and trying new foods

### How will I ensure that my kids are getting enough calcium, protein, and all other necessary vitamins and minerals?

* Eat a rainbow of fruits and vegetables every day. 
* **Eat [protein](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/) and [iron](https://www.vrg.org/nutrition/iron.php) rich foods with every meal**
* Ensure an adequate source of [calcium (e.g., fortified soy or pea protein milk, tofu, leafy greens, tahini, blackstrap molasses)](https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-information/health-concerns-about-dairy/calcium-and-strong-bones) every day
* [Eat whole grains (whole wheat bread, brown rice, whole grain or legume-based pasta)](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/whole-grains/)
* Limit refined grains such as white bread, pasta, rice, sugary foods, and [highly processed foods](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/processed-foods/)
* If you are feeding your children exclusively plant-based foods, **give a supplement of Vitamin B12 and iodine** (unless you use iodized salt)
* Take a **Vitamin D supplement and enjoy the SUNSHINE**
  
  
## HELPFUL RESOURCES
  
* [_Nourish_](https://nourishthebook.com/) is a recently published book (November 2020) written by a pediatrician and a dietician that very thoroughly describes the myriad benefits of eating more plant-based foods, explains the evidence behind their recommendations, provides clear dietary guidelines and includes a section with recipes.
