#All About Environmental Allergies

Nasal allergies are very common, and the **most common cause of
morning stuffy nose is an allergy to dust mites (especially if the symptoms are present year
round).** 

(![alttext](https://community.aafa.org/fileSendAction/fcType/5/fcOid/504165950920930791/fodoid/504165950920930790/imageType/LARGE/inlineImage/true/asthma-awareness-common-allergic-triggers-dust-mites-mold-pets-pollen.png)

If you suspect your child has allergies, pay attention to any clear triggers and then modify your environment accordingly.

If your child continues to have troublesome symptoms (such as nighttime cough, ear pain or hearing issues), I recommend giving allergy medicine daily.  Allergy medicines include nasal steroids (such as flonase) and/or oral non-drowsy antihistamine (zyrtec, claritin, allegra, etc) daily. Benadryl is also an oral antihistamine, but makes children drowsy and only lasts 4-6 hours.
