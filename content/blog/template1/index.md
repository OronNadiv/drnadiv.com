#All About Environmental Allergies

Nasal allergies are very common, and the **most common cause of
morning stuffy nose is an allergy to dust mites (especially if the symptoms are present year
round).**

If you suspect your child has allergies, pay attention to any clear triggers and then modify your environment accordingly.

If your child continues to have troublesome symptoms, I recommend giving a nasal steroid (such as flonase) and/or an oral non-drowsy antihistamine (zyrtec, claritin, allegra, etc) daily. Benadryl is also an oral antihistamine, but makes children drowsy and only lasts 4-6 hours.
