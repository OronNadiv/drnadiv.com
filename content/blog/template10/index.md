Happy Birthday to You, Happy Birthday to You, Happy 1st Birthday to Your Child, Happy 1st Birthday to You! 12 months is such a momentous time. Your infant is now a toddler and will continue to keep you busy as ever---even more so! I recommend the following changes at 12 months:

* ###Nutrition
		*Whereas breast milk and formula made up the bulk of your infant's diet (although less so as he approached 12 months), now your 12 month old should be eating mostly solid foods, and can eat soft versions of the food you are making for the whole family
        
        *Toddlers (and kids) DO NOT NEED special "kid food!"
    	
        *If you have been breastfeeding, feel free to continue for as long as you and your toddler are both enjoying it. It remains a nutritious and immune-rich beverage for your growing toddler. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/) recommends exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age, with "continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond."
        
        *If your baby has been on formula, she no longer needs formula for her nutritional needs. Some parents continue their children on "toddler formulas," but these are not necessary. Babies do not need more than about 16 ounces of milk per day, and too much milk can limit your baby's appetite for solid foods. 
        
        *Many parents transition to whole milk at this time. Whole milk is a convenient source of fat, protein, calcium, and some (but not enough) Vitamin D. It is not, however, necessary since toddlers can get these nutrients from other foods as well. If you choose to give your toddler whole milk, it's important to give no more than 16 ounces per day. Too much whole milk can lead to iron deficiency anemia
