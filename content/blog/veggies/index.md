I spend A LOT of time talking to families about nutrition and I hear one comment several times each day:

### **“Doctor, my child doesn’t like vegetables!”** 
<br/>
I know parents struggle to give their kids healthy meals, but I suggest a frameshift.  I endorse the [**Division of Responsibility in Feeding**](https://www.ellynsatterinstitute.org/satter-feeding-dynamics-model/) where parents decide what to serve and children decide what and how much they eat.  This model does not include accomodating a child’s likes and dislikes.

**Simply put, parents are in charge of providing healthy nutrition, and children LEARN TO EAT what is served**.

When I talk to families about starting babies on solids, I also emphasize that it often takes a baby up to 15 tries to accept some foods, especially vegetables that are more bitter.

[Evolutionarily, we are programmed to like sweet foods](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-evolution-of-the-sweet-tooth-79895734/), but we can learn to eat bitter and other savory foods. 

Now I know this is much easier said than done, and I get frequent complaints from my own kids when they don’t like the food I’ve made…

As I’ve said many times, **parenting isn’t easy** and it’s not our job to be our childrens’ friends. **Rather, we are their teachers, supporters and loving guides**. 

**There are ways to encourage healthy eating:**
* Bring your kids to the farmer’s market and let them select produce
* Let your kids help with food prep and cooking
* Get involved in a community garden, or grow a few plants at home
