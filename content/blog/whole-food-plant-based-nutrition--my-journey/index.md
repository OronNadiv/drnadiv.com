I have been a vegetarian since my junior year of college. Growing up, I ate meat because my parents gave it to me as the focal point of my meals, but I never liked it. It always seemed strange that I was eating another animal’s flesh. I was especially uncomfortable when I ate meat with “bones.” Like most American kids, I happily ate hamburgers and hotdogs with ketchup on white bread, with a side of french fries.  As long as I didn’t really focus on the fact that I was eating another animal’s flesh, it was easy to lose awareness that I was indeed eating a dead animal’s muscles (and who knows what else).   

I became a vegetarian during my junior year of college when I spent a semester in southern Mexico with the [School for International Training](https://www.sit.edu/). It just so happened that of the five other students in my program, four were vegetarian. Up until that semester, I didn’t even know that being vegetarian was something you could do.  I was thrilled to learn that I could legitimately label my natural dietary tendencies, and stop apologizing for not liking meat.

During and after my semester in Mexico, I read a book by [John Robbins](https://www.johnrobbins.info/) called Diet for a New World.  (Not coincidentally, John Robbins is the only son of the founder of the Baskin-Robbins ice cream empire).  Reading his book, I was astonished to learn how eating meat is an ENORMOUS contributor to [greenhouse gas emissions](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/what-is-the-climate-impact-of-eating-meat-and-dairy/#:~:text=A%20taste%20for%20meat%20has,of%2015%2Dto%2D1.&text=Meat%20and%20dairy%20specifically%20accounts,and%20Agricultural%20Organization%20(FAO).) and global warming. This was a major epiphany for me, and I passionately re-envisioned my personal and career goals. In fact, I returned to Duke my junior year and changed my major from Biology (I was pre-med along with at least half of my freshman class) to Religion and told my parents I planned to work in [sustainable agriculture](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/what-sustainable-agriculture)!  I spent much of my senior year of college learning about Integrative Medicine. I even found a kindred spirit amongst my friends and we led a student-led ”[house course](https://trinity.duke.edu/house-courses)” at Duke on Integrative Medicine for two semesters. 

After learning about world religions and different ways to practice healing, I guess I wasn’t sure that I wanted to pursue medical school.  I considered applying to [naturopathic medical school](https://aanmc.org/naturopathic-schools/), but I ultimately decided to take some time off to figure things out. I spent a year doing an AmeriCorps community service program ([City Year](https://www.cityyear.org/))) in San Jose.  During my “city year,” my big ideals of being a naturopath or a sustainable farmer seemed out of touch with mainstream America when I encountered a 5th grade Latino US citizen who couldn’t read. How did I not know about the degree of injustice and inequality rampant in our communities?  This led me to the conclusion that if I really wanted to WORK IN THE COMMUNITY, straight-up med school was the way to go!  

Twenty plus years, a husband and two kids later, I have just had another epiphany!  While I have known a purely plant-based diet is healthiest for the earth, I was always told that plant foods do not provide “complete proteins.” I thought you had to have the proper ratio of rice and beans, etc, etc.  It always seemed too complicated and too impossible, so I continued eating dairy products and eggs.  Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t mind eating cheese, yogurt and ice cream. Who doesn’t love cheese with it’s morphine-like chemicals?  And yogurt is delicious! My favorite was the Trader Joe’s chocolate.  I always remarked that I ate it like dessert, but it was healthy because “it was yogurt.” But it actually is dessert because all flavored yogurts are loaded with SUGAR (or artificial sugar)!  

Admittedly, after breastfeeding my girls for a year and thinking that I was supposed to now start them on cow’s milk, it felt more than a little weird to me.  I never really drank cow’s milk growing up, and I remember feeling awkward buying a gallon of cow’s milk to feed my daughters instead of my own milk. No one suggested that I continue breastfeeding for 2+ years. I loved breastfeeding and continued until both of my girls were 2 and a half years old. Funnily, I did this thinking that I was mainly giving my girls emotional support and connection. Despite the fact that the [WHO and UNICEF recommend breastfeeding until age 2 or longer](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infant-and-young-child-feeding#:~:text=WHO%20and%20UNICEF%20recommend%3A,years%20of%20age%20or%20beyond.), since I have always lived in the US, long-term breastfeeding for nutrition seemed trivial and maybe even wrong.

That is because we live in a country with a VERY strong dairy industry. Dairy is part of the USDA [my plate](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/). It’s actually declared “a food group”: vegetables, fruit, protein, grains and dairy. I never thought to question it because it was government-approved (and promoted)! 

But look at what [Canada advises](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/)?!!  Now, the groups are vegetables and fruits, grains and protein with water to drink. How logical.  Absolutely fascinating! And disturbing.  We have been brainwashed into thinking that we need to drink cow’s milk, but we should not and do not need to.  [Frank Oski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Oski), a well-renowned pediatrician (the Oski of _Oski’s Pediatrics_--a popular pediatrics textbook, former chair of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Medical School, and a founder and editor of the Contemporary Pediatrics journal) wrote a book in 1977 called [Don’t Drink Your Milk](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Drink-Your-Milk-Frank/dp/1479601659).  He also worked collaboratively with the famous [Dr. Benjamin Spock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Spock) and the [Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine](https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-for-kids) to [criticize the dairy industry](https://greensboro.com/dr-spock-leads-criticism-dairy-industry-denies-charge-that-milk-is-bad-for-children/article_8c6c1569-36a6-5e1a-9532-1d54131bca2c.html).  

I recently completed a course on [plant-based nutrition](https://nutritionstudies.org/courses/plant-based-nutrition/), and I hope to inspire you all to re-think what we eat and why. I want to emphasize that thinking about changing our diets is HARD, and it doesn’t have to be 100%. I just want to help raise awareness that the healthiest foods are whole foods and plant-based. I still get my girls pizza on occasion, and they love sour cream and cheese when we order burritos. We do this maybe once a week----I’m ok with that. I know that, for me, I have been feeling so much more energetic on a fully plant-based diet, but everyone has their own comfort levels. The more plant-based whole foods you can incorporate into your family’s diet, the healthier you will be.
