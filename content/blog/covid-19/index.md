# Overwhelmed by COVID-19 information? It's a scary time, but know that we at are here for you!

Hello everyone! At this surreal time of social distancing, working from home and overwhelming online information about COVID-19, I want to share a few of my thoughts. 

* Many families are concerned about COVID-19 exposures and asking for children to be tested. For children specifically, testing is unlikely to change how we care for your child, since COVID-19 will likely cause symptoms similar to the common cold in most children. We know that children can become infected with COVID-19 and can spread it to others in the community, so it's **important to keep sick kids at home.** 

* In an effort to minimize community spread, we are trying to keep potentially positive COVID-19 patients out of the medical center, and are doing most of our visits over the telephone or video. As doctors, we are now largely working from home, which has its own unique challenges as we struggle with you all to both work and parent/teach. 

* I know how isolating it can feel at home, but please reach out with your questions/concerns/fears! We are HERE for you! As hard as this is for all of us, remember to hug your children, try to focus on the present moment, and wash your hands!
